A Time table has both incoming and outgoing for weekday, saturday and sunday

Usage Patterns would include:

Search for a station, what services leave from this station in next 5 minutes, where are they going?
=> Can we scrape the gps coordinates for each station, so we can use the geo location to search for
a station.

The Station is going to be the main search pattern


STATION
-------
ID (Use the ptv ID)
NAME
GPS_COORD (If available)

LINE
----
ID (Use the time table line id)
NAME 
START_STATION_ID
END_STATION_ID

A service that does not necessarily go all the way to the end station, but does it matter?
 

SERVICE
-------
ID - sequence
LINE_ID
STATION
TIME


Can it satisfy
